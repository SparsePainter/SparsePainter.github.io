Here we created the website for [SparsePainter](https://sparsepainter.github.io/) using the [mm-github-pages-starter template](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter).


The source codes for SparsePainter are available at the [SparsePainter original GitHub repository](https://github.com/YaolingYang/SparsePainter).
